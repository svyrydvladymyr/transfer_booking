    "feedback1" : "Our train was almost an hour late, but the driver was waiting for us, as agreed, was patient and polite. Very good price and comfortable minibus. Payment was non-cash, which is also very convenient. I recommend this company for cooperation",
    "feedback_name1" : "Ðžlesya",
    "feedback2" : "Perfect service. The driver was friendly, waiting for us with a sign, helped with luggage. The car was comfortable and clean. They also ordered a return transfer. The car arrived on time,  we arrived quickly and safely. I will definitely use your services next time",
    "feedback_name2" : "Yana",
    "feedback3" : "Ordered a transfer in both directions - from the railway station to the hotel and back to the airport. Everything was great, a spacious car with a large trunk, a punctual driver. Our hotel was located on the mountain, the driver took us to the front door. Thank you very much",
    "feedback_name3" : "Oleg",
    "feedback4" : "100% recommend! Adequate prices, minibuses with seat belts for all passengers, stops on demand on the road. I'm satisfied",
    "feedback_name4" : "Alexander",
    "feedback5" : "I booked a transfer in advance. The day before the trip I got a call to clarify the relevance of my order. They sent me contacts of the driver and car number. Everything was convenient, on time, as agreed. Safe and professional driving. Good price. Highly recommend",
    "feedback_name5" : "Vyacheslav",
    "feedback6" : "I reserved transport for 25 people for a trip to a corporate party in the Carpathians. There were 2 minibuses, back 1 bus. It was comfortable, plenty of place for things. Our company was a bit noisy, but the driver was not annoyed. We arrived perfectly and comfortably. Thanks",
    "feedback_name6" : "Denis",
    "feedback7" : "Everything was timely and professional. We traveled with two small children (2 and 4 years old), so we were looking for a company that could offer a minibus transfer with two child seats and a large trunk for suitcases, a stroller and ski equipment. I even asked twice if there really would be 2 car seats ðŸ˜Š and was pleasantly surprised. All our wishes were taken into account. This is the best service I have ever encountered when traveling to the Carpathians.",
    "feedback_name7" : "Sergii",
    "feedback8" : "Great service at a price lower than a taxi. We went together with my girlfriend, we were met and picked up on time. The trip was fast, safe and comfortable. The driver is a professional, he took us to a place where I probably would not risk driving my own car in such weather conditions. They also ordered a return transfer, everything was OK. I will recommend your company to all  my friends.",
